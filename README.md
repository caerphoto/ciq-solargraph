# Japanese Diver Garmin Watch Face

A simple, slightly custimisable analog watchface for Garmin smartwatches based
on the classic "SKX" diver from a well-known Japanese watch manufacturer.




For watches with MIP display, there is an option to always show the second hand, even when inactive.

If you wish to apply the customized colors select "Custom" mode in the settings. The color of the second hand will be always the custom one specified in the settings, even in "Theme" mode.
